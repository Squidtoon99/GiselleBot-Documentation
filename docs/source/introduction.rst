Introduction & History
======================

**GiselleBot** is a Discord bot, developed by Cyc (cycloptux#1543 on Discord).

Giselle was born as a "small" project to help the Brave Frontier-based Coalition (a group of people that played the same mobile game, Brave Frontier, from gumi Inc.) handle the kind-of-complicated (and fully documented, thanks to my friend and partner NaviKing) members application workflow.
Her main goal back when she started was pinging roles in our Discord server every once in a while and reminding them to answer to an application using her commands.
The project evolved and became quite big, to a point where she managed to handle the whole application workflow on her own, with minimum user input.

Over time, a lot of side functions were added to help with day-to-day Discord usage, moderation, logging, roles management and so on.

The bot is now becoming a strong moderation bot, trying to absorb and enhance all of the main features coming from the "big bots" like Tatsumaki, Mee6, Nadeko...
