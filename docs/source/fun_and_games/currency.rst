Currency System
***************

Each user known to the bot has a currency wallet. Currency is earned in a few ways:

* Each message sent in a channel the bot has access to will give a small amount of currency to the user (a cooldown is applied to avoid plain spamming just to earn currency).
* Once a day, using the :ref:`timely` command.
* Every once in a while, reacting to events on the main bot support server.
* Playing with :ref:`games`.

Currently, the main goal of currency is playing with games. More uses are planned, but still not implemented.

Stonk Market: Buying and Selling Broccoli
=========================================

The **Stonk Market** allows users to buy and sell ðŸ¥¦ broccoli at fluctuating prices, just like real stock markets.

ðŸ¥¦ broccoli can be purchased **every Sunday morning before 12 PM UTC**. Their price fluctuates over time: **the purchase price will be different every week, and in every server**. During the week, users can sell ðŸ¥¦ broccoli at different prices to make a profit. These prices will differ each morning and afternoon, and again, for each server.

The pricing algorithm is the same that powers Animal Crossing: New Horizons's Stalk Market. You can read more about it `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bSVNpOnH_dKxkAGr718-iqh8s8Z0qQ54L-0mD-lbrXo/edit#>`_ .

Buying prices vary between 90 and 110 currency per head of ðŸ¥¦ broccoli. There's no limit on how many you can buy or sell.

ðŸ¥¦ broccoli must be sold within a week. Otherwise, **they will rot by the following Sunday morning and lose their monetary value**. |bot_name| will dispose of them for you when they are no longer good.
