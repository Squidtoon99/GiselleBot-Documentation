Invite |bot_name| to your Discord Server
****************************************

|bot_name| is a public bot and can be invited by anyone in any server.

If you share a Discord server with |bot_name|, it is advised that you get an update invite by running |bot_prefix|\ invite in any channel she's in (usually, look for a bot spam channel, just in case).

If you don't, here's a direct invite: |bot_invite|

The set of permissions that |bot_name| asks for enables most, if not all, of its commands in your server. Giving administrator permissions is advised if you are going to use it for logging and moderation purposes, but it's not required.

.. note::
    By default, not all of |bot_name|'s commands are enabled for everyone in a server. Refer to :ref:`permissions` for more info.
