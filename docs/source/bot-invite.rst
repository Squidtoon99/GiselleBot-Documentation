Invite GiselleBot to your Discord Server
****************************************

**GiselleBot** is a public bot and can be invited by anyone in any server.

If you share a Discord server with GiselleBot, it is advised that you get an update invite by running |bot_prefix|\ invite in any channel she's in (usually, look for a bot spam channel, just in case).

If you don't, here's a direct invite: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=356831787445387285&permissions=301329654&scope=bot

The set of permissions that Giselle asks for enables most, if not all, of her commands in your server. Giving administrator permissions is advised if you are going to use her for logging and moderation purposes, but it's not required.

Please note that, by default, not all of GiselleBot's commands are enabled for everyone in a server. Refer to :ref:`permissions-system` for more info.
